├── main.py         # Main game loop and window setup
├── paddle.py       # Paddle class for movement
├── ball.py         # Ball class with movement and bounce logic
└── scoreboard.py   # Scoreboard class for tracking points
```

## 🧠 How It Works

* The ball moves continuously and bounces off the top and bottom walls.
* If it hits a paddle, it bounces back; if it passes a paddle, the other player scores a point.
* First to a set number of points wins (or keep playing endlessly!).

---

## 🧰 Future Enhancements

* [ ] Add a single-player mode with AI
* [ ] Add sound effects using `winsound` or `pygame`
* [ ] Add difficulty levels and game modes
* [ ] Visual improvements and animations
